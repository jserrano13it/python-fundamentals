# EZ ATM Simulator 🏦

This is a simple command-line ATM simulator built in Python to reinforce foundational programming concepts from Modules 1–3 of the Python Fundamentals series.

## 💡 Purpose

This project was created as a hands-on exercise to solidify learning in:

- ✅ Module 1: Variables, input/output, and string formatting
- ✅ Module 2: Control flow using `if/elif/else`, comparison operators, and user input handling
- ✅ Module 3: Functions with parameters and return values, modular design, and reusable logic

## 🚀 Features

- PIN-based access control
- Menu-driven interface with options to:
  - Show current balance
  - Deposit funds
  - Withdraw funds (with overdraft protection)
  - Exit the session
- Modular function design for clarity and reuse
- Input validation and formatted output using f-strings

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a Python program using functions
- How to pass and return values between functions
- How to handle user input and update state (balance) dynamically
- How to organize code for readability and future expansion
