# Python Fundamentals â€“ Learning & Practice Repository

**Author:** Jose Serrano  
**Purpose:** A collection of Python practice modules and miniâ€‘projects built while learning core programming concepts.  
This repository documents my progress through foundational Python topics, with each folder focusing on a specific skill area.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### `basics/`
Covers the very first steps in Python:
- Variables and data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- User input with `input()`
- Printing output with `print()`
- Simple math operations
- Example: `variables.py` â€“ prompts for player name, sets a starting score, and displays a welcome message.

### `control_flow/`
Introduces decisionâ€‘making in Python:
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Example programs that respond differently based on user input.

### `projects/`
Miniâ€‘projects that combine multiple concepts:
- Early work on an interactive **Quiz Game** (Modulesâ€¯1â€“3)
- Complete ATM_Simulation
- Will expand into more complex or visual projects (e.g., Snake game) as skills progress.
